A bar chart which shows the number of rape cases reported in India, state wise across a period of 2001 - 2010.

The visual is interactive, that is, we can set the year according to our choice using a slider. On hovering over the bar of each state, we can see the literacy rate and
population of that state according to the Indian census data of 2001.

Most datasets used in this analysis were collected from Kaggle.
